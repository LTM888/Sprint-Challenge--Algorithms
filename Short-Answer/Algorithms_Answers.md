#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Logarithmin)(lon n) is the run time for this, the size of the input increses the space used will grow at a slightly slower rate.


b) Polynomial , as the size of n increase the space use will grow as well.


c) Linear Time , because we are only 2 things for this code and it's a constant addition of 2.

## Exercise II

I think this would be a linear search for which floor the egg drop off and  drop off > F else drop off < F to detemine if the egg was to break or not .
