#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) since n is called 5 times the runtime is 0(n) Linear .

b) due to the multiple nested loops this would be a quadrtic 0(n^4).

d) since not much is happening and the results will come out just the same this run time is linear 0(n)

## Exercise II

This sound like the best case for Binary Search which will then give this the run time of 0(logn). Since this building has n-th amounts of  floors  I fell like binary would be the best bet, using the informaion that was given we now somewhat on what the parameters are we cen now find the postion of the egg and assest if it will break for not.
